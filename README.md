Start with 3 lives and lose one when colliding with a ghost.
Reset Mechanism:
Restart the game when lives run out.
Dynamic Map Reloading: 
The maze reloads with new food after clearing all food items.

Controls:
Arrow Keys: Move Pac-Man in the desired direction.
Restart Game: Press any key after the game over to restart.
